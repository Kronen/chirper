# Chirper

Chirper is a microblogging platform developed with Java EE
Chirper is meant to replicate the basic feature set of a microblogging platform.
That means: finding users, browsing profiles, follow/unfollow, send text posts limited to 256 characters, 
retransmiting and direct/private messages, search of words in all posts, trending topics...
